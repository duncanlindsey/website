                <p>
		            This website is an experiment, inspired by the elegant simplicity of 
                    <a href="https://sive.rs" class="external">sive.rs</a>, <a href="https://paulgraham.com" class="external">paulgraham.com</a>
                    and the interesting minds behind them.

                <h2>Me in 10 seconds</h2>
                <p>
                    I love making things on my own for others, and learning things with others for me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think most often about systems, strategies, stories and design. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been an organic chemist, a management consultant, a charity trustee and product manager.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am now a tech-for-good founder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will always be a son, brother and best friend.
